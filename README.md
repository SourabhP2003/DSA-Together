# DSA-Together
Hello I am Sourabh Kisan Pawar. Studing in SE Artificial Intelligence and Data Science
I want to learn DSA because it is perfect for solving real life problems (which is also most demanded) and I also want to improve my problem solving skill.
Also it is important in coding interview point of view.
